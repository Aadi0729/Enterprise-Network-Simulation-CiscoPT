# Enterprise-Network-Simulation-CiscoPT 🖧

This project simulates an enterprise-level network architecture using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, built to understand and practice core networking concepts. It includes real-world lab setups covering:

- ✅ DHCP (Dynamic IP Assignment)
- 🌐 DNS (Domain Name Resolution)
- 🔄 VLAN Segmentation & Isolation
- 📡 Inter-VLAN Routing using Router-on-a-Stick

---

## 🔧 Labs Included

| Lab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `Lab1_DHCP.pkt` | Router assigns IPs using DHCP |
| `Lab2_DNS.pkt`  | DNS server resolves local domain names |
| `Lab3_VLAN.pkt` | VLANs configured for network isolation |
| `Lab4_InterVLAN_Routing.pkt` | Communication between VLANs via router sub-interfaces |

## 🎯 Key Concepts Practiced

- Subnetting & IP allocation
- VLAN creation, access & trunk ports
- DHCP server configuration on router
- DNS setup with domain simulation
- Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
