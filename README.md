# Enterprise-Network-Simulation-CiscoPT 🖧

This project simulates an enterprise-level network architecture using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, built to understand and practice core networking concepts. It includes real-world lab setups covering:

- ✅ DHCP (Dynamic IP Assignment)
  
  ![DHCP Configuration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fbc04c7-0dac-4268-a242-6d23db0534b7)
  
- 🌐 DNS (Domain Name Resolution)

- 🔄 VLAN Segmentation & Isolation

## 🔧 Labs Included

| Lab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `Lab1_DHCP.pkt` | Router assigns IPs using DHCP |
| `Lab2_DNS.pkt`  | DNS server resolves local domain names |
| `Lab3_VLAN.pkt` | VLANs configured for network isolation |
| `Lab4_InterVLAN_Routing.pkt` | Communication between VLANs via router sub-interfaces |
